**_What's the meaning of life? It seems quite brash to answer such kind of questions. But I should try this time. The meaning of life is for people to figure out the objects that can be hardly described in their own language, which is also the inherent mission for each one. When you find the objects free of descriptions, you have found some missing pieces from the puzzle painting yourself completely. Just like the eye cannot see itself, when seeking the truths of yourself, you should focus on the things darker than the shadow, rather than those conspicuous objects. So simply speaking, life's meaning is to find yourself. It doesn't mean that the nature has broken you in pieces deliberately in advanced, it makes more sense that the nature just selected parts of itself to create you. It is not quite straightforward to understand this mission/meaning for life. Because almost each guy is born to learn a first language, the so-called mother tongue, which would initialize a deceptive premise in our mind (the basic operating system) that everything can be described in language. And based on this premise, we have categorized most parts of our mood and past experience, like sense of achievement, sense of happiness, excitement, love, or sadness, desperation, misunderstanging, pain, etc. Sometimes we would get lost in these instant feelings and start to deepen our thinking, free of all of those that can be easily defined or described, whether we can suffer from something more mysterious with no word to label. Gradually we can find that the magic of language is that it has created an opposite set in a contradiction to our words, containing those things that cannot be defined or described. So have you see that? Language is the detector to dig out the real meaning of your life. And when you learn a foreign language, you can have different types of detectors to double-check or even triple-check whether the treasures you have found are the missing pieces of yourself or not. This is also one of the reasons why I develop my own website to store some stories in English. But I should also preserve a 'prefecture' for my mother tongue，which is the meaning of this special chapter._**
